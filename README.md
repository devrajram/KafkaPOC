# KafkaPOC
This project is all about Kafka POC using Spring-Kafka API. 

Producer - How to create a producer and produce a message to a given topic. Currently the producer is setup to send message to a topic "kafkapoc"
Consumer - How to create a consumer and listen for messages to a given topic "kafkapoc".

A restful API is available "/send/{message}" to send message to producer and then producer publishes message to the topic.

In future version this will be enhanced to cover more scenarios.
